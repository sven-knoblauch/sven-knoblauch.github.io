                <h2>Rasterization</h2>
                In the <strong>Rasterization Stage</strong>, the main goal is the convertion of primitives to an image of pixels. There are multiple ways to approximate a shape and translate it to
                an realistic pixel image. Here we are discussing the procedure of midline algorithm. This algorithm can be implemented for multiple shapes. In this example we will discuss
                the shapes of a line and a circle.

                
                <h2>Midpoint Line Algorithm</h2>
                Let's start with the <strong>assumption</strong>, that the slope of the line is smaller than one but none negative. For all other posibillities, the rasterized line can be mirrored
                and rotatet, so all possible lines are commemorated. Starting with these assumption at the start point, there are only two possible pixels which are relevant for the next pixel,
                for on the pixel in the east (E) and the pixel in the nort-east (NE). Between these two point the midpoint is calculated. to determine witch pixel will be used, the <strong>only test</strong>
                which has to performed is, if the line is above or below the middle point. If the line is above, the pixel in the north-easst corner is used, otherwise the east pixel is used. This
                procedure can be performed interatively, when the change of the line is descriped with its derivative, which reduces the number of multiplications.

                <h2>Midpoint Algorithm for Circles</h2>
                To draw a circle, only an <strong>eighth</strong> of the cirlce has to be drawn, all other pixels can be mirrored and rotated. For this shape a <strong>decision Function</strong> is defined. The decision if
                the next pixel is in the east (E) or in the south-east (SE), is made with the midpoint between these two points. The east pixel is used if the midpoint is not in the circle, otherwise the south-east
                pixel is used. For optimization, the gradient can be calculated to reduce the number of multiplicaitons. For other shapes, like an ellipse, multiple cases has to be implemented to
                accompensate different tangents of the points.

                <h2>Example</h2>
                The following example is producing lines and circles at random with the discussed algorithms. For the implementation, the javascript files can be inspected. For the
                color of the lines, a simple interpolation between two colors are made.
